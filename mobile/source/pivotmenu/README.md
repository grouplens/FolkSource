PivotMenu
=========

PivotMenu - an Enyo 2.0 kind to roughy emulate the Windows Phone 8 Pivot Menu control that provides a 'tabbed'-like control for switching between panels with custom titles.

You can side between panels by either tapping the headers or dragging the panels.

See example in "sample" directory.


NOTES:

- if there are only two panels, and sliding backward rather than forward, the visible panel appears to be moving in the wrong direction.
